# Operating Systems

Even so, the way we use it today is definitely new. The main idea is that a
VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor) creates the illusion of multiple (virtual) machines
on the same physical hardware. A VMM is also known as a hypervisor. As
discussed in Sec. 1.7.5, we distinguish between type 1 hypervisors which run on
the bare metal, and type 2 hypervisors that may make use of all the wonderful services
and abstractions offered by an underlying operating system. Either way, virtualization
allows a single computer to host multiple virtual machines, each potentially
running a completely different operating system.

In fact, the ability to run at the same time applications that use
different operating systems is a big argument in favor of virtual machines


Application Architect is a person having a holistic view of the application (system) and who can think strategically and see the bigger picture. He shall have thorough understanding of all components in the system and what are their responsibilities. He should have a wide knowledge of available tools, popular standards and work techniques. Such knowledge is indispensable to make right, strategic decisions for the project that are difficult to change later.
Architect should not only present his vision , guidelines ,mandates and best practices but also explain the reasoning behind all â€“ what are the drivers? Invite discussion and questions and leave some decisions to the team so that team is empowered and have freedom and ownership over the decisions. Also during the course of development he should provide continuous guidance to development team to develop higher quality code, a more maintainable system, and a system that meets performance and scalability requirements on day one without requiring a ton of rework.
Another skill set that is equally important is having the necessary soft skills to understands the stakeholders development plans and building consensus among different groups and getting buy-in form various stakeholders.
Last but not the least I believe an architect should be hands on who can code Proof of Concepts and can roll up his sleeves and can pair program with the development team in critical times.
